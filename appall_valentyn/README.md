# Appall Valentyn

This folder contains Valentyn's implementation of the event search functionality based on the branch: https://github.com/vpodk/the-network_ai/tree/vpodk/search/voice_integration

## Purpose

This folder serves as a reference implementation for alternative approaches to event search and integration with the main application. It can be used to compare different implementation strategies and potentially incorporate useful features into the main codebase.

## Integration Notes

The code in this folder is separate from the main application flow and serves as a reference only. To use any features from this implementation, they should be carefully reviewed and integrated into the main voice_integration module.

## Features

- Alternative implementation of event search functionality
- Reference code for potential future enhancements
- Experimental features that may be incorporated into the main codebase
