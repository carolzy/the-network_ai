About Event

​The sciences are no doubt critical in driving action and influencing climate policy, however, many people are inspired to take action once they have connected with the realities of climate change on an emotional level. This connection can be experienced through stories that move beyond mainstream representations, in the form of art – literature, music, visual art, theatre, film and more.

​This session aims to demonstrate and encourage art as an important mechanism to drive social change, focusing on climate conversations. Our panelists will highlight the role the arts have to play in driving social change, discuss their experiences of how art has had an impact on the climate conversation, and share their own creative projects.

​The session will also include an opportunity for you to workshop your own socially-driven creative ideas with the panelists, where you will leave with the foundations of a new (or existing) creative project.

The event will be co-hosted by [Andy Rapista](https://www.instagram.com/andyrapista/), climate activist and founder of [Mad Earth](https://madtravel.org/) and co-hosted and moderated by Karan Rathod, founder of [Alfaaz](http://www.alfaazcollective.com/) – a literature and arts collective that helps writers and artists get their creative work out, improve literary skills; and to leverage the arts for social change.

About Event

​What if your everyday financial choices could help fight climate change? From where you bank and invest to how you spend and save, every dollar has an impact. Yet, most of us don’t realize the power we hold—or how to wield it effectively.

​In this interactive session, we’ll explore how individuals can align their money with their values, why this matters in the grand scheme of corporate and government climate action, and the real opportunities to drive change through sustainable finance.

​You’ll leave with practical strategies to:

- ​Shift your banking and spending to support climate-friendly businesses

- ​Invest in sustainability without sacrificing returns

- ​Understand the broader systems at play—governments, corporations, and financial markets

- ​Take immediate action to make a difference


​We’ll also introduce a new **proof of concept**, inviting 10-20 early adopters to help shape an innovative solution designed to make personal finance simple, sustainable, and impactful. If you’re ready to put your money where your values are, this session is for you!

​ _UPDATE: Due to initial demand and venue capacity we are dividing this into two sessions._

- ​ _Session 1 - 12:30-1:30pm ('Session 1' ticket)_

- ​ _Session 2 - 1:45-2:45pm ('Session 2' ticket)_

About Event

​How do I turn my breakthrough science into a startup? Am I addressing a problem with a large enough market? How do I recruit a team? Am I the right person to do it?

If you're curious about entrepreneurship, join us to hear Alex Teng, Partner at [Fifty Years](https://www.fiftyyears.com/5050), share insights from helping hundreds of scientists translate breakthrough science into deep tech startups.

We'll dive into how to identify civilization-scale problems to tackle, break down ideas into fundable milestones, develop essential entrepreneurship skills (from hiring to fundraising to negotiating IP), and grow into a great founder.

Fifty Years is an early-stage VC firm. At 50Y, we’ve built deep tech companies ourselves and published the Spinout Playbook, a full guide to spin out of academia. We've backed over 100 deep tech startups and helped them raise over $4.6B.

We've distilled everything we know about deep tech entrepreneurship into 5050, a free program to help great scientists and engineers become great founders.

Whether you're validating an idea or unsure whether entrepreneurship is right for you, see you at Stanford.

About Event

​Special Screening of the IOFF Official Selection and Award Winning film Sequoias of the Sea, followed by Q&A with the film directors.

​More than 95% of the kelp forests have disappeared along the Northern California Coast. SEQUOIAS OF THE SEA tells the story of the environmental, cultural and economic destruction impacting a coastal town that has lost its coastal kelp forest. It’s a deep dive into the lives of fishermen, tribes, scientists, and a community working to restore a habitat devastated by a warming climate.

​Be part of the movement to save our underwater forests. Connect with passionate conservationists, engage in meaningful discussions, and learn how we can work together to restore our coastal habitats.

About Event

​Note: while there are many guests listed in the RSVP, most of these are carried over from previous events in this series. We don't expect much more than 30 to attend.

""Imagination without reason is mere fancy, but reason without imagination is sterile. That is partly why scientists and philosophers alike have always used imaginary scenarios to help sharpen their ideas and push them to their limits."" - _The Pig that Wants to be Eaten_, by Julian Baggini

For this meeting (Apr 16), we'll be discussing ethical distinctions brought to light by the trolley problem:

- ​Please read this primer on how to engage with thought experiments: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1obO4Nb0J5RGNcC-lsy\_lvJdPNcmhq0CXgp2WDytXBpo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1obO4Nb0J5RGNcC-lsy_lvJdPNcmhq0CXgp2WDytXBpo/edit?usp=sharing)

- ​It is highly recommended but not required to go deeper by reading this article beforehand: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/)


​Some examples of things we've discussed at past meetings:

- ​Could a vegetarian eat a pig with a clear conscience, if that pig wanted to be eaten?

- ​Does a person survive using a teleporter that destroys the body and recreates it with perfect fidelity?

- ​Does the existence of evil in the world pose a problem for belief in a benevolent God?


​We'll be meeting in the 550 Room (down the stairs on the North side). Contact me by text if you're having trouble finding the location.

​On the Wednesdays when we're not running this event, we'll often be having similar discussions here: [https://lu.ma/shortstories](https://lu.ma/shortstories)

About Event

​ **Join us for a celebration of art, culture, and connection to the land and water on April 26, 2025.**

​Science, art, and culture are linked together, and shape the ways we understand ourselves and the world around us. California Native culture bearers and artists have connected to the land and waters through artistic practice and scientific inquiry since time immemorial. In partnership with the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone and American Indian Cultural District, the Exploratorium welcomes you to the third annual California Native Homeland Festival.

​The celebration will be a sharing of Indigenous artistic and cultural practices that come from deep traditions knowing and living with the California landscape. Don’t miss this opportunity to meet renowned Native artists and cultural bearers, and discover your own relationship with the landscape around us.

​ _Curated in partnership with Gregg Castro (Ramaytush Ohlone, T’rowt’raahl Salinan, Rumsen), cultural director for the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, and Jennifer Bates (Northern Sierra Mewuk), cultural festival curator and basket weaver._

Hard Tech and Hard Pavement: SFCW25 Welcome Run with Ammobia and Banc of Cal,Kick off SF Climate Week with a run in San Francisco's biggest and most beautiful park!,"Monday, April 21",7:00 AM - 8:30 AM PDT,"Alvord Lake, San Francisco, California",https://lu.ma/4is1ot7h,Ammobia,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,"Ammobia is on a mission to revolutionize the ammonia industry. We are a seed-stage startup developing Haber Bosch 2.0 – a next-generation ammonia synthesis process enabling cost-effective, clean ammonia production. Until now, ammonia production has been a highly polluting, steady-state, high inertia process. We are developing new regimes of physics and plant design that require dynamic processes, especially for ammonia production from intermittent renewable energy sources. Clean ammonia will support ammonia’s growing role in our decarbonized world, tackling some of the most difficult to abate sectors including chemicals, fertilizers, and heavy-duty transportation. We are supported by leading climate tech organizations including Starlight Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Third Derivative, Forbes 30u30, and more. Banc of Cal supports tech and life sciences startups with free bank accounts for pre-seed & seed companies, a perks platform, and a team of bankers to support founders as they scale. For VC-backed companies, we offer a non-dilutive venture debt product, lending from $1MM up to $60MM for growth, working capital or runway extension.","![Cover Image for Hard Tech and Hard Pavement: SFCW25 Welcome Run with Ammobia and Banc of Cal](https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,background=white,quality=75,width=400,height=400/event-covers/9r/9e3461df-6e6a-4de0-ae21-76521aff2b6a.png)

About Event

​Kick off SF Climate Week with a run in San Francisco's biggest and most beautiful park!

​Ammobia is hosting a run/walk for anyone in the climate tech / hard tech space, interested in starting the week outside, in one of the most beautiful urban parks in the country.

​We'll lead two groups Starting from near Lake Alvord in Golden Gate Park:

- ​A 3km walk around the Conservatory of Flowers \[ [Strava](https://www.strava.com/routes/3324206122505736272)\]

- ​A 7km park loop to a redwood grove, social pace, with different pace groups if needed. \[ [Strava](https://www.strava.com/routes/3324204734139442306)\]


​Both groups will end back near where we start for Coffee and pastries at \[Location TBD\] afterwards.

​If coming from downtown, the N-Judah can drop you off at Stanyan and Carl St, only a few blocks from our start point.

​Ammobia is on a mission to revolutionize the ammonia industry. We are a seed-stage startup developing Haber Bosch 2.0 – a next-generation ammonia synthesis process enabling cost-effective, clean ammonia production. Until now, ammonia production has been a highly polluting, steady-state, high inertia process. We are developing new regimes of physics and plant design that require dynamic processes, especially for ammonia production from intermittent renewable energy sources. Clean ammonia will support ammonia’s growing role in our decarbonized world, tackling some of the most difficult to abate sectors including chemicals, fertilizers, and heavy-duty transportation. We are supported by leading climate tech organizations including Starlight Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Third Derivative, Forbes 30u30, and more.

​Banc of Cal supports tech and life sciences startups with free bank accounts for pre-seed & seed companies, a perks platform, and a team of bankers to support founders as they scale. For VC-backed companies, we offer a non-dilutive venture debt product, lending from $1MM up to $60MM for growth, working capital or runway extension.

About Event

​Harvest is the smartest HVAC on Earth.

​Come take a live tour of a Harvester's home in the Mission to feel the magic of a Smart Thermal Battery. It's integrated heating, hot water, and air conditioning all in the same system. Not as sexy as an EV, but a lot comfier (and more impactful).

​It's heat pumps, but way smarter (and cheaper).

​More tours - including a happy hour - coming soon. Watch this space.

About Event

​ [​Bayou Energy](https://www.bayou.energy/), [Palmetto](https://palmetto.com/home-electrification/palmettos-new-energy-intelligence-api), [Shovels](https://www.shovels.ai/), [Stepchange](https://www.stepchange.vc/), [Texture](https://www.texturehq.com/) and [Virta Ventures](https://www.virtaventures.co/), are hosting a 1 day in-person hackathon during San Francisco Climate Week 2025.

​This hackathon is for all–whether you’re just exploring the idea of working in climate to energy veterans. Come with an idea or just some energy and we’ll help you get paired up with a team to get building!

​​If you want to skip the hacking and just see what everyone builds [you can sign up for just the demos here (Tuesday, April 22nd 10-11am PT](https://lu.ma/k46kv4m4)).

​We’ll have a mix of judges from fellow investors— [Russell Sprole from Virta Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russellsprole/), [Charles Oppenheimer from Oppenheimer Project](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleso/) and [Tim Connors from PivotNorth Capital](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothyjconnors/) to active product builders and founders — [Juliet Rothenberg (Product Director of Google Climate AI)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julietrothenberg/) and [Tom Mercer (VP Product at Rewiring America)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomercer/).

​We'll provide you with free access to the Bayou, Palmetto, Shovels and Texture products (details below) as well as other developer resources.

# ​​​Who should attend?

# ​Product Details

## ​Bayou Energy

​ [Bayou Energy](https://bayou.energy/) provides a suite of APIs for companies to effectively deploy clean energy devices across many utilities.

​Our first product is a utility API that gives companies access to any metered utility data instantly and reliably. The API takes minutes to integrate. Consumers authenticate their utility accounts with one-click, and developers get access to utility account, bill data, and interval meter data in 60 seconds or less from >60% of US utility meters.

​Check out [Bayou’s docs](https://docs.bayou.energy/docs/quickstart) or [get started for free with the product](https://staging.bayou.energy/users/sign_up).

## ​Palmetto

​With nothing more than an address, Palmetto’s Energy Intelligence API returns estimated home energy consumption and production, as granular as hourly, broken down by fuel type and disaggregated to end use. The user may optionally fine-tune estimates by providing any of 60+ attributes about the home, or calibrating on known past energy consumption or production. The user may also pass hypothetical home attributes, allowing them to simulate the impact of home upgrades on the energy footprint.

​The API also returns estimated cost and carbon impact of the home.

​More details about the API can be found [here](https://palmetto.com/home-electrification/palmettos-new-energy-intelligence-api), and full API docs can be accessed at [ei.docs.palmetto.com](http://ei.docs.palmetto.com/). Developers can also make use of the [interactive demo](https://ei.palmetto.com/demo), which allows users to run simulations via a simple UI, complete with visualizations of key outputs.

## ​Shovels

​ **Shovels company/product overview.** **What will participants get access to when participating in the hackathon?**

​ [Shovels](http://shovels.ai/) makes building permit data useful. We continuously track, normalize, and categorize hundreds of millions of building permit records across the country. Shovels enables our customers to explore, profile, and derive actionable insights from our database of residential, commercial, and contractor records.

​Shovels’ API gives customers access nationwide building permit and contractor data, which includes over 170M building permits monthly and 3M contractors. Customers also use Shovels to filter permits by category (e.g. solar, electrification, heat pump, etc.) and to find property, homeowner, and contractor firmagraphic information associated with permit data.

​Link to API documentation [here](https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/permits/search-permits).

## ​Texture

​Texture is the **developer platform for energy**—a powerful API-first system designed to help you quickly integrate, analyze, and act on energy data. Whether you’re working with **solar panels, batteries, EV chargers, smart thermostats, or utility data**, Texture gives you the tools to build **smarter, more connected energy apps** without the headache of wrangling messy, inconsistent data.

​ **Why Texture?**

- ​ **Plug & Play APIs** – Get **real-time** access to energy telemetry, utility bill data, geolocation info, and more with simple, well-documented APIs.

- ​ **Intuitive Dashboard** – See your data in action with **powerful visualization tools** that make debugging a breeze.

- ​ **Apps & Integrations** – Extend Texture with **third-party services**, (including **Shovels!)** for rapid data ingestion.

- ​ **Great Docs & Fast Setup** – Get started in minutes, not hours. We’ve built Texture to be as **developer-friendly** as possible.


​ **Get Started**

​The Texture platform is designed to be **fast, flexible, and fun** to build with—perfect for Hackathon projects. Whether you’re making a **next-gen smart home app** or a **grid-aware automation tool**, Texture gives you **the data and tools** to bring it to life.

​Anyone can just go to our website [https://www.texturehq.com](https://www.texturehq.com/) and sign up to get started for free

​API docs with platform concepts documented here at [https://docs.texturehq.com/](https://docs.texturehq.com/) ​

About Event

​Most Climate Week events talk about change. This event gives us all a chance to build it. Join us to close out SF Climate Week with creativity, community, and hope.

​

We’ll kick off with a series of fast-paced lightning talks from experts, implementers and funders in the climate space, including from Project Drawdown, Vibrant Data Labs and Kiva — highlighting data and real-world insights on how women-led climate initiatives are consistently underfunded. These quick, compelling shares will set the stage for collective action.

​

From there, the room becomes a workshop. You’ll join a small table group together with the panellists and designers from IDEO [.](https://ideo.org/) orgto use the tools of design futuring to create an object of the future: a tangible artifact that represents the regenerative, gender-just world we’re working toward.

Expect conversation, collaboration, and a creative close to SF Climate Week where you’ll have the opportunity to synthesize everything you’ve learned and questioned during the week. Refreshments and light appetizers by women-owned businesses will be served!

About Event

​The fair returns **April 18-20, 2025**, to the fun and funky Hotel del Sol, the iconic 1950s motor lodge in the beautiful Marina District adjacent to the Bay, the Palace of Fine Arts, and the Golden Gate Bridge.

​Startup will run concurrently with the prestigious San Francisco Art Fair at Fort Mason, which is within walking distance of the del Sol. By aligning with SF Fair, a cornerstone of the Bay Area art scene since 2011, we're participating in what promises to be an extraordinary weekend of art discovery in San Francisco where tens of thousands of visitors will be coming to discover and buy art.

​Created for artists, by artists, **Startup Art Fair** is a unique platform where independent talents take control of their careers and connect directly with collectors, curators, and art professionals in an intimate boutique hotel setting.

​ **Startup** is a destination event, attracting artists, art industry leaders, and art collectors from across the U.S. and as far away as Mexico, China, Europe, and South America. The fair’s unwavering mission to support creative and professional success for independent artists makes us a beacon for starting and seasoned collectors who seek out unique experiences and innovative brands.

About Event

​The fair returns **April 18-20, 2025**, to the fun and funky Hotel del Sol, the iconic 1950s motor lodge in the beautiful Marina District adjacent to the Bay, the Palace of Fine Arts, and the Golden Gate Bridge.

​Startup will run concurrently with the prestigious San Francisco Art Fair at Fort Mason, which is within walking distance of the del Sol. By aligning with SF Fair, a cornerstone of the Bay Area art scene since 2011, we're participating in what promises to be an extraordinary weekend of art discovery in San Francisco where tens of thousands of visitors will be coming to discover and buy art.

​Created for artists, by artists, **Startup Art Fair** is a unique platform where independent talents take control of their careers and connect directly with collectors, curators, and art professionals in an intimate boutique hotel setting.

​ **Startup** is a destination event, attracting artists, art industry leaders, and art collectors from across the U.S. and as far away as Mexico, China, Europe, and South America. The fair’s unwavering mission to support creative and professional success for independent artists makes us a beacon for starting and seasoned collectors who seek out unique experiences and innovative brands.

About Event

​Note: while there are many guests listed in the RSVP, most of these are carried over from previous events in this series. We don't expect much more than 30 to attend.

""Imagination without reason is mere fancy, but reason without imagination is sterile. That is partly why scientists and philosophers alike have always used imaginary scenarios to help sharpen their ideas and push them to their limits."" - _The Pig that Wants to be Eaten_, by Julian Baggini

For this meeting (Apr 16), we'll be discussing ethical distinctions brought to light by the trolley problem:

- ​Please read this primer on how to engage with thought experiments: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1obO4Nb0J5RGNcC-lsy\_lvJdPNcmhq0CXgp2WDytXBpo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1obO4Nb0J5RGNcC-lsy_lvJdPNcmhq0CXgp2WDytXBpo/edit?usp=sharing)

- ​It is highly recommended but not required to go deeper by reading this article beforehand: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/)


​Some examples of things we've discussed at past meetings:

- ​Could a vegetarian eat a pig with a clear conscience, if that pig wanted to be eaten?

- ​Does a person survive using a teleporter that destroys the body and recreates it with perfect fidelity?

- ​Does the existence of evil in the world pose a problem for belief in a benevolent God?


​We'll be meeting in the 550 Room (down the stairs on the North side). Contact me by text if you're having trouble finding the location.

​On the Wednesdays when we're not running this event, we'll often be having similar discussions here: [https://lu.ma/shortstories](https://lu.ma/shortstories)

About Event

​ **Join us for a celebration of art, culture, and connection to the land and water on April 26, 2025.**

​Science, art, and culture are linked together, and shape the ways we understand ourselves and the world around us. California Native culture bearers and artists have connected to the land and waters through artistic practice and scientific inquiry since time immemorial. In partnership with the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone and American Indian Cultural District, the Exploratorium welcomes you to the third annual California Native Homeland Festival.

​The celebration will be a sharing of Indigenous artistic and cultural practices that come from deep traditions knowing and living with the California landscape. Don’t miss this opportunity to meet renowned Native artists and cultural bearers, and discover your own relationship with the landscape around us.

​ _Curated in partnership with Gregg Castro (Ramaytush Ohlone, T’rowt’raahl Salinan, Rumsen), cultural director for the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, and Jennifer Bates (Northern Sierra Mewuk), cultural festival curator and basket weaver._

About Event

​How do I turn my breakthrough science into a startup? Am I addressing a problem with a large enough market? How do I recruit a team? Am I the right person to do it?

If you're curious about entrepreneurship, join us to hear Alex Teng, Partner at [Fifty Years](https://www.fiftyyears.com/5050), share insights from helping hundreds of scientists translate breakthrough science into deep tech startups.

We'll dive into how to identify civilization-scale problems to tackle, break down ideas into fundable milestones, develop essential entrepreneurship skills (from hiring to fundraising to negotiating IP), and grow into a great founder.

Fifty Years is an early-stage VC firm. At 50Y, we’ve built deep tech companies ourselves and published the Spinout Playbook, a full guide to spin out of academia. We've backed over 100 deep tech startups and helped them raise over $4.6B.

We've distilled everything we know about deep tech entrepreneurship into 5050, a free program to help great scientists and engineers become great founders.

Whether you're validating an idea or unsure whether entrepreneurship is right for you, see you at Stanford.

About Event

## ​ _/ YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED ? ConGrAtS ! Now, PLEASE BUILD YOUR TEAMS ON_ _[DISCORD](https://discord.gg/Y3TFTmE89g)_ _PRIOR TO DAY-0 /_/    **👾** **[Re-Weird the Web](https://hackathon-website-blush.vercel.app/)** **\- SF Hackathon 👾**

​​ **Go WeIRd oR go hoMe**

​ [Ariana.dev](https://ariana.dev/), [Entrepreneurs First](https://www.joinef.com/) & [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) are joining forces to bring the ultimate hackathon event of SF.

​People used to have fun on the internet. There were fewer trolls, bots, ads and content farms. Web creators made straight-up magical wonders. These days, everything looks like Tailwind and smells like AI, and nobody’s making real art. **THAT’S ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE.**

​Come together for two days with creative coders who are bringing skill, imagination and weirdness back to product development: the only hackathon where you can make anything you want, as long as you make it **WeIRd**.

​

* * *

## ​​​🏆 **The Challenge - 3 TRACKS**

1. ​ **Games:** Playable, interactive experiences. Bring the most absurd game to life, where you and your friends can finally live your wildest dreams— step into Jeremy shoes & launch blue oranges to the moon, soar over seas of bugs as a hero from Ancient Mythology, or simply achieve the impossible: get your commit reviewed in under three days.

2. ​ **Satire & Humor:** Memes, parodies, and spoofs that cut deep. Invent a Vs-code extension that randomly spawns fresh bugs following a NP-complete algorithm.

Launch the ultimate recursive grift : marketplace of markeplatce of marketplace of ... (while (true) { marketplace = `${marketplace} of ${marketplace}`; } ) . Because you can. & Because capitalism.

Design the utmost dystopian app: AI-generated cats in a blender. ( _Yes, it’s tragic. But hey, now you can afford those overpriced eggs during the next inevitable shortage_.)

In short : Go wild. Make us cry. Make us laugh.

3. ​ **Actually That’s Quite Useful: Apps that make you say “actually that’s quite useful.”**


​

* * *

## ​​​🗓️ **Event Details**

- ​​​ **Date:** Saturday, April 12th (9AM to 21PM)

- ​​ **Location** : in the exceptional offices of [Entrepreneurs First](https://www.joinef.com/) in the heart of SF -> in person event

- ​​​ **Participants:** 100 spots

- ​​​ **Prizes:** Plushes, Hoodies, FuN & more to come


* * *

## ​​​🍱 The **set-up (Teams & Food)**

​​​We’ll be providing **delicious food and drinks** to keep you fueled throughout the event.

​Teams should consist of **3 to 5 participants**, with each person required to register and be individually accepted. No teams? No worries, we will help making sure you find teammates prior to the event.

​Please note, **this is an in-person event,** and online participation will not be available.

* * *

## ​​​🎁 **What's in it for you** ​

​ _FUN - ART - CREATIVITY - Curiouser & Curiouser? Welcome to Wonderland._

​​​Lots of updates on the jury, mentors, ressources, and prizes coming soon!

* * *

## ​​​ **🌠** **Guidelines**

​Participants should …

- ​Develop using common web development languages and frameworks: ie, JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend or backend (Node.js), Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.

- ​Build for the web, and make it **Good Weird.**


​ **What is Good Weird?**

- ​ **Bad Weird**: Your product is soulless, mean and corporate. It makes people’s eyes glaze over. It has bugs. \|

- ​ **Good Weird**: Your product sparks joy.  It makes your ICP smile. It has one bug, Jeremy. He’s your mascot.


​ **Can I use AI when building at this hackathon?**

​Yes, you can use AI, but with taste. Don’t automate the humanity out of your project. And yes, that’s highly subjective.

About Event

​ _[SuperHuman Society](http://sprhmn.org/)_ _&_ _[Imbue](http://imbue.com/)_ _Presents “Visions of the Future Hackathon”_

​ **Where is humanity headed as AI, robotics, and other breakthrough tech reshape our world?**

​If you've ever imagined how our future might look like, this event is for you.

​Join us for a non-technical hackathon where curious minds come together to envision tomorrow's utopia… or dystopia, through short stories ( [vignettes](https://morereasonable.com/)) paired with AI-generated visual art.

​Teams will collaborate, build on each other's ideas, and create shared visions of possible futures. The final outputs will be compiled into a **physical book** and locked into a **digital time capsule**, capturing our collective hopes, dreams, and fears in this exact point in history.

​ **Who is this event for?**

- ​Technologists

- ​Social Scientists, Philosophers, Historians

- ​Futurists

- ​Artists

- ​Anyone and everyone who cares about our collective future.


​ **What You'll Do**

- ​ **Join a Team:** Get matched with other participants at the start of the event to form diverse teams that blend technical insight, artistic vision, and storytelling.

- ​ **Collaborate & Storyboard:** Work together to explore and expand each other's ideas into rich future scenarios. Brainstorm possible scenarios—maybe post-labor world or a society run by nano-robots—and shape them into short, compelling storyboards through group ideation and refinement.

- ​ **Make it Visual:** Bring these imaginations to life through AI-generated art.

- ​ **Create a Lasting Record:** See your team's work published in a physical book and preserved online, solidifying your collective voice in the conversation about humanity's next chapter.

- ​ **Get Inspired & Connect:** Enjoy talks from guest speakers, connect with fellow humans.


​ **Why is there a $20 ticket price?**

​We’re asking for a small fee to ensure commitment—free events often suffer from unpredictable turnout. Your ticket helps create a high-quality experience for all attendees.

​ **What’s included?**

Coffee & snacks in the morning

Lunch to fuel your creativity

Happy hour with light bites to celebrate and connect

​ **Where does the money go?**

Proceeds will help us place printed copies of the final book in public spaces, ensuring that the visions we create together are shared widely and spark meaningful conversations.

​Whether you're excited about tomorrow's possibilities or worried about the risks, you have a place here.

​ **Come add your voice—and vision—to our shared future.**

​Organizers:

​ _The_ **_[SuperHuman Society](http://sprhmn.org/)_** _exists for those who refuse to accept a dehumanized future. We bring together thinkers, founders, artists, and technologists committed to designing a world where technology amplifies human dignity instead of diminishing it._

​ **_[Imbue](https://imbue.com/)_** seeks to radically expand what computing can do for people and to distribute its creative power to all.

About Event

​What if your everyday financial choices could help fight climate change? From where you bank and invest to how you spend and save, every dollar has an impact. Yet, most of us don’t realize the power we hold—or how to wield it effectively.

​In this interactive session, we’ll explore how individuals can align their money with their values, why this matters in the grand scheme of corporate and government climate action, and the real opportunities to drive change through sustainable finance.

​You’ll leave with practical strategies to:

- ​Shift your banking and spending to support climate-friendly businesses

- ​Invest in sustainability without sacrificing returns

- ​Understand the broader systems at play—governments, corporations, and financial markets

- ​Take immediate action to make a difference


​We’ll also introduce a new **proof of concept**, inviting 10-20 early adopters to help shape an innovative solution designed to make personal finance simple, sustainable, and impactful. If you’re ready to put your money where your values are, this session is for you!

​ _UPDATE: Due to initial demand and venue capacity we are dividing this into two sessions._

- ​ _Session 1 - 12:30-1:30pm ('Session 1' ticket)_

- ​ _Session 2 - 1:45-2:45pm ('Session 2' ticket)_


​

_By registering for this event, you agree to share your registration information with the organizers of SF Climate Week._

# ​ **Let's hang!**

​​​Join Hustle Fund and the SF founder community to connect with other founders and hear from an entrepreneur with wild stories and expert advice.

# ​Meet Humphrey Yang

![User Uploaded Image](https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,quality=75,width=800,height=800/editor-images/3y/9401577f-8451-491f-83b9-6640b67fdeb5.jpg)

​Humphrey is the world's largest financial advice YouTuber.

​Humphrey is the founder and CEO of [HumphreyTalks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFBpVaKCC0ajGps1vf0AgBg), a brand with over 4 million subscribers across YouTube and social media.

​When I think of a financial advisor, I think of a boomer in a dusty suit sitting behind a desk using words I don't understand.

​That is not Humphrey. Humphrey covers everything from investing and entrepreneurship to tax hacks and personal finance in a way that's digestible... and without a trace of BS.

​His on-camera persona is kind of like a super nice big brother — he knows way more than you, but he's willing to share his knowledge because he genuinely wants you to thrive.

​So what makes Humphrey qualified to give +4 million people financial advice?

​He spent years in finance, working at JPMorgan before launching his own e-commerce ventures. His deep understanding of both Wall Street and online business gave him an edge in explaining complex financial topics in a way that actually makes sense.

​Since launching HumphreyTalks, his influence has exploded. His content reaches hundreds of millions of views annually, and he’s turned his media brand into a powerhouse, partnering with major financial platforms, fintech startups, and global brands.

​Now, Humphrey isn’t just educating — he’s building. Through strategic investments, partnerships, and new media ventures, he’s redefining what it means to be a creator in finance. He’s proving that the next generation of financial education won’t come from institutions — it’ll come from dynamic, trusted voices like his.

​​​Join us on Monday, April 28, for a fireside chat with Humphrey to hear about his journey building a modern media empire, including the largest financial advice YouTube channel in the world.

About Event

​Join us for a panel discussion on how changing wildfire activity is affecting ecosystems, water resources, and communities, and the importance of science for solutions. The panel is hosted by the Western Fire and Forest Resilience Collaborative and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

​Our panelists Lori Moore-Merrell, Hilary Franz, Lara Kueppers, and Winslow Hansen will discuss lessons learned from the LA fires and similar events, regional trends in fire, and risks to water resources and forest health. Panelists will share their experience with the use of science to inform strategies for managing fire in communities, ecosystems, and where they mix.

​The conversation will be of interest for anyone concerned with fire, water resources, or climate resilience. Learn how science-based solutions can build resilience in a rapidly changing environment.

​ **Panel Members:**

​ **Lori Moore-Merrell,** Former US Fire Administrator in the Biden Administration

​ **Hilary Franz,** Former Washington State Commissioner of Public Lands

​ **Lara Kueppers,** Professor of Climate Change and Ecosystem Dynamics, UC Berkeley

# ​Product Details

## ​Bayou Energy

​ [Bayou Energy](https://bayou.energy/) provides a suite of APIs for companies to effectively deploy clean energy devices across many utilities.

​Our first product is a utility API that gives companies access to any metered utility data instantly and reliably. The API takes minutes to integrate. Consumers authenticate their utility accounts with one-click, and developers get access to utility account, bill data, and interval meter data in 60 seconds or less from >60% of US utility meters.

​Check out [Bayou’s docs](https://docs.bayou.energy/docs/quickstart) or [get started for free with the product](https://staging.bayou.energy/users/sign_up).

## ​Palmetto

​With nothing more than an address, Palmetto’s Energy Intelligence API returns estimated home energy consumption and production, as granular as hourly, broken down by fuel type and disaggregated to end use. The user may optionally fine-tune estimates by providing any of 60+ attributes about the home, or calibrating on known past energy consumption or production. The user may also pass hypothetical home attributes, allowing them to simulate the impact of home upgrades on the energy footprint.

​The API also returns estimated cost and carbon impact of the home.

​More details about the API can be found [here](https://palmetto.com/home-electrification/palmettos-new-energy-intelligence-api), and full API docs can be accessed at [ei.docs.palmetto.com](http://ei.docs.palmetto.com/). Developers can also make use of the [interactive demo](https://ei.palmetto.com/demo), which allows users to run simulations via a simple UI, complete with visualizations of key outputs.

## ​Shovels

​ **Shovels company/product overview.** **What will participants get access to when participating in the hackathon?**

​ [Shovels](http://shovels.ai/) makes building permit data useful. We continuously track, normalize, and categorize hundreds of millions of building permit records across the country. Shovels enables our customers to explore, profile, and derive actionable insights from our database of residential, commercial, and contractor records.

​Shovels’ API gives customers access nationwide building permit and contractor data, which includes over 170M building permits monthly and 3M contractors. Customers also use Shovels to filter permits by category (e.g. solar, electrification, heat pump, etc.) and to find property, homeowner, and contractor firmagraphic information associated with permit data.

​Link to API documentation [here](https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/permits/search-permits).

## ​Texture

​Texture is the **developer platform for energy**—a powerful API-first system designed to help you quickly integrate, analyze, and act on energy data. Whether you’re working with **solar panels, batteries, EV chargers, smart thermostats, or utility data**, Texture gives you the tools to build **smarter, more connected energy apps** without the headache of wrangling messy, inconsistent data.

​ **Why Texture?**

- ​ **Plug & Play APIs** – Get **real-time** access to energy telemetry, utility bill data, geolocation info, and more with simple, well-documented APIs.

- ​ **Intuitive Dashboard** – See your data in action with **powerful visualization tools** that make debugging a breeze.

- ​ **Apps & Integrations** – Extend Texture with **third-party services**, (including **Shovels!)** for rapid data ingestion.

- ​ **Great Docs & Fast Setup** – Get started in minutes, not hours. We’ve built Texture to be as **developer-friendly** as possible.


​ **Get Started**

​The Texture platform is designed to be **fast, flexible, and fun** to build with—perfect for Hackathon projects. Whether you’re making a **next-gen smart home app** or a **grid-aware automation tool**, Texture gives you **the data and tools** to bring it to life.

​Anyone can just go to our website [https://www.texturehq.com](https://www.texturehq.com/) and sign up to get started for free

​API docs with platform concepts documented here at [https://docs.texturehq.com/](https://docs.texturehq.com/) ​

About Event

​Special Screening of the IOFF Official Selection and Award Winning film Sequoias of the Sea, followed by Q&A with the film directors.

​More than 95% of the kelp forests have disappeared along the Northern California Coast. SEQUOIAS OF THE SEA tells the story of the environmental, cultural and economic destruction impacting a coastal town that has lost its coastal kelp forest. It’s a deep dive into the lives of fishermen, tribes, scientists, and a community working to restore a habitat devastated by a warming climate.

​Be part of the movement to save our underwater forests. Connect with passionate conservationists, engage in meaningful discussions, and learn how we can work together to restore our coastal habitats.

About Event

​The sciences are no doubt critical in driving action and influencing climate policy, however, many people are inspired to take action once they have connected with the realities of climate change on an emotional level. This connection can be experienced through stories that move beyond mainstream representations, in the form of art – literature, music, visual art, theatre, film and more.

​This session aims to demonstrate and encourage art as an important mechanism to drive social change, focusing on climate conversations. Our panelists will highlight the role the arts have to play in driving social change, discuss their experiences of how art has had an impact on the climate conversation, and share their own creative projects.

​The session will also include an opportunity for you to workshop your own socially-driven creative ideas with the panelists, where you will leave with the foundations of a new (or existing) creative project.

The event will be co-hosted by [Andy Rapista](https://www.instagram.com/andyrapista/), climate activist and founder of [Mad Earth](https://madtravel.org/) and co-hosted and moderated by Karan Rathod, founder of [Alfaaz](http://www.alfaazcollective.com/) – a literature and arts collective that helps writers and artists get their creative work out, improve literary skills; and to leverage the arts for social change.

​Harvest is the smartest HVAC on Earth.

​Come take a live tour of a Harvester's home in the Mission to feel the magic of a Smart Thermal Battery. It's integrated heating, hot water, and air conditioning all in the same system. Not as sexy as an EV, but a lot comfier (and more impactful).

​It's heat pumps, but way smarter (and cheaper).

​More tours - including a happy hour - coming soon. Watch this space.

About Event

​Most Climate Week events talk about change. This event gives us all a chance to build it. Join us to close out SF Climate Week with creativity, community, and hope.

​

We’ll kick off with a series of fast-paced lightning talks from experts, implementers and funders in the climate space, including from Project Drawdown, Vibrant Data Labs and Kiva — highlighting data and real-world insights on how women-led climate initiatives are consistently underfunded. These quick, compelling shares will set the stage for collective action.

​

From there, the room becomes a workshop. You’ll join a small table group together with the panellists and designers from IDEO [.](https://ideo.org/) orgto use the tools of design futuring to create an object of the future: a tangible artifact that represents the regenerative, gender-just world we’re working toward.

Expect conversation, collaboration, and a creative close to SF Climate Week where you’ll have the opportunity to synthesize everything you’ve learned and questioned during the week. Refreshments and light appetizers by women-owned businesses will be served!

​ **This Month’s Pick:** **_Sea of Tranquility_** **by Emily St. John Mandel**

​What if time isn’t as linear as we think? _Sea of Tranquility_ takes us on a mesmerizing journey across centuries, weaving together lives that seem worlds apart—until they converge in ways both mysterious and profound. From a 1912 Canadian wilderness to a moon colony in the 2200s, Mandel crafts a story about time, memory, and the nature of reality.

​ **About the Author:**

Emily St. John Mandel is an acclaimed Canadian author best known for _Station Eleven_, a post-apocalyptic novel that won the Arthur C. Clarke Award and was adapted into an HBO series. Her works often blend speculative fiction with literary depth, exploring themes of fate, connection, and the passage of time.

​ **Awards & Recognition:**

_Sea of Tranquility_ was a **New York Times Bestseller** and a **Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Best Science Fiction**. It was praised by _The Washington Post_ and _The New York Times_ as one of the best books of the year.

​ **This Month’s Pick:** **_Sea of Tranquility_** **by Emily St. John Mandel**

​What if time isn’t as linear as we think? _Sea of Tranquility_ takes us on a mesmerizing journey across centuries, weaving together lives that seem worlds apart—until they converge in ways both mysterious and profound. From a 1912 Canadian wilderness to a moon colony in the 2200s, Mandel crafts a story about time, memory, and the nature of reality.

​ **About the Author:**

Emily St. John Mandel is an acclaimed Canadian author best known for _Station Eleven_, a post-apocalyptic novel that won the Arthur C. Clarke Award and was adapted into an HBO series. Her works often blend speculative fiction with literary depth, exploring themes of fate, connection, and the passage of time.

​ **Awards & Recognition:**

_Sea of Tranquility_ was a **New York Times Bestseller** and a **Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Best Science Fiction**. It was praised by _The Washington Post_ and _The New York Times_ as one of the best books of the year.

About Event

​​An experiment, a spin on our usual format, focused on connection and growth.

​Everyone will come with the music learned (able to sing through with few / no mistakes). We'll be off music for the second half, focusing on connecting with the music and each other, and working in smaller ensembles to hone our skills.

​We'll be singing I Just Called To Say I Love You, as covered by Pentatonix.

​PREPARATION REQUIRED,

​PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE RECOMMENDED (intermediate and advanced singers - we'll be singing 2 or 1 person per part). Test if you're ready by playing the original on a speaker and singing along on your part, and then listen back.

​$5 minimum, but no one turned away for lack of funds (email robert.acahub@gmail.com).

​

Sheet music PDF provided - please bring a device to view it, or print your own copy.

​FYI, there will be photos and videos taken at the event which may be used in future marketing materials.
